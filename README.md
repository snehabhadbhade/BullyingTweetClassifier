# BullyingTweetClassifier

People talk,report,accuse,defend about bullying on social media and we are trying to identify the bullying traces in the tweets using sophisticated machine learning algorithms.

We are using University of Wisconsin-Madison's Bullying Traces Data Set to train a classifier model that identifies whether a tweet could be classified as having active bullying traces. For more information on the Bullying traces, visit http://research.cs.wisc.edu/bullying/data.html

The BullyingClassifier.py expects two files Bully_train and Test_train that would contain labelled set of tweets from the data set for building a classifier.

We have held out around 200 tweets for testing out of 3000 tweets.
